# Sessions
Sessions is a tool that allows you to save and access your different digital workspaces.

<h2>How it works</h2>
Sessions saves all open apps and their relevant data (files, websites, window sizes, etc.) in a singular JSON file as a "session". It can update this file as you close and open other processes, and open other sessions entirely (via their files).
<br>
This is a good way to navigate the complexities of working on multiple projects at once. 
<br>

<h2>How to install</h2>
The current Sessions prototype runs through AppleScript and Automator (for the time being).
<h3>1. Download the Apple Scripts</h3>

<h2>Suggested Sessions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Daily digest with multiple websites</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding new apps</h2>
There has to be some level of AppleScript support for new apps. I also have to add the file icon to the dictionary, so it knows which .icns file to pull data from. It's a whole thing that's a problem!!

<h2>Future changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A functional Menu Bar App</li>
  <li>Additional third-party app compatibility</li>
  <li>Support for multiple desktop spaces</li>
  <li>Options for timing</li>
  <li>UI Update</li>
  <li>Shift to Xcode App completely</li>
  <li>Add suggested Sessions</li>
  <li>Open to suggestions!</li>
</ul>
