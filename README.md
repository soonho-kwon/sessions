# Sessions
Sessions is a tool that allows you to save and access your different digital workspaces.

<h2>How it works</h2>
Sessions saves all open apps and their relevant data (files, websites, window sizes, etc.) in a singular JSON file as a "session". It can update this file as you close and open other processes, and open other sessions entirely (via their files).
<br>
This is a good way to navigate the complexities of working on multiple projects at once. 
<br>

<h2>How to install</h2>
The current Sessions prototype runs through AppleScript and Automator (for the time being).
